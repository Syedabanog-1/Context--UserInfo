Context management refers to the technique of managing resources or states (like variables, sessions, environments, etc.) during the execution of a program or function, ensuring proper setup and cleanup (e.g., opening/closing files or managing temporary data).

 RunContextWrapper is a special wrapper used in the OpenAI Agent SDK to hold and manage the execution context during a run. It gives access to metadata (like input, user info, history, etc.) and is passed to functions/tools to dynamically adapt based on the user's session or data.
 
** Example use case:**
Inside a @function_tool,
if define def func(wrapper: RunContextWrapper):, 
it means function will have access to the full run context (like user input, config, previous steps, etc.).


Objective of this programe:
**************************
This Python program demonstrates how to build a simple AI agent using the OpenAI Agent SDK. The agent retrieves and displays structured user information (name, age, alive status, roll number) from a User_Info model in response to a natural language prompt. It uses the function_tool feature to fetch contextual data and dynamically guide the agent's behavior.

Workflow:
*********
**Model Definition (User_Info):

A Pydantic model is created to define the schema of user data, including name, age, roll number, and alive status.

**Context Initialization:

A sample user (Ali) is created using the User_Info model and passed as the agentâ€™s context.

**Instruction Setup (dynamic_ins):

A function dynamically gives instructions to the agent, telling it to use the user_information tool to fetch the user details.

**Tool Definition (@function_tool):

A function tool named user_information is registered to extract and return user information from the context in a formatted string.

**Agent Configuration:

An Agent is created, named "Triage Agent", using:

***the instructions function,

***the model from config,

***and the user_information tool.

**Runner Execution:

A user prompt is defined asking for the user's roll number, name, age, and alive status.

The Runner.run() function executes the agent using the prompt and context.

**Final Output:

The agent returns the extracted information using the function tool and the result is printed using rich.print() for styled terminal output.

OUTPUT DISPLAY:
***************

The user's roll number is: q110110, and his name is: Ali. His age is: 23, and alive status: True.
